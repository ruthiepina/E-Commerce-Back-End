# E-Commerce Back End

![License Badge](./assets/badge.svg)

## Description

This application started with a working Express.js API that was then confirmed to interact with a MySQL database through the use of
Sequelize, which is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) tool.

The walkthrough video below shows the app's functionality for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API routes, demonstrated by use of RESTful CRUD
operations.

The app also uses the MySQL2 package to connect to the MySQL database and perform queries, the Sequelize package to interact with the
database using OOP and JavaScript instead of having to use SQL commands in the terminal, and the dotenv package to secure sensitive data
like the username, password, and database name of your MySQL.
